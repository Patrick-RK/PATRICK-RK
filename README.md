# 👋 Hi, I'm Patrick Killeen

I'm a 33 year old Irish / Venezuelan that live in China for 5 years and have just finished up a working holiday visa in Japan where I worked as a python Instructor. I'm looking forward to seeing what the next opportunity in life is going to be. 


Since the pandemic, I've been reupskilling in tech, starting with a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Analytics, and just this September, I finished my Master's in Data Analytics.

## 🎓 Master's Thesis
My Master's thesis focused on the impact of cumulative head trauma on fighter performance in the UFC using Machine Learning. The project was broken down into three key steps:

1. **Scraping:** Collecting fight data and statistics from various sources using Python beautifulsoup and selenium.
2. **Database** SQLite was used to saved scraped data which was happened into csv format for ease of cleaning.  
3. **Cleaning:** Data was cleaning was done in R however some. There were some cleaning and joining was also performed in python using pandas and one or two issues were cleaned up in excel. Premodelling was performed in Python using Jupyter notebooks.
4. **Modeling:** Building predictive models to understand how career trauma affects fighter performance. The models were tested and created in both R and Python
5. **Visualizations** were added using seaborn, matplotlib and tableau to provide insights into the results of study.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, R,  SQL (PL/SQL, SQLite, Oracle).
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Flask, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Tools:** Git, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Tableau
- **Platforms:** Big Query

-**Currently Learning:** Typescript, Expo

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On
- **Weekly Organiser**:Organiser that is based on on medicine wall charts to prioritise repeating tasks
- **Game Development:** Experimenting with a roguelite FTL style autobattler using pygame and LLM generated events

## 🛠️ Other Projects
- **Kanji Memorization Aid:** A React-based app that generates Anki cards to support the rapid memorisation of Kanji through recollection. 
- **Guitar Fretboard Visualisier**: An app I built to experiment with flask that helps visualise the fretboard based on the note relationships rather than their position on the board to help acquire music theory faster.


## 🎸 Personal Interests

Love learning languages, I speak fluent Spanish, decent Mandarin (HSK3/4), I play videogames in French better than speak it and have picked up bits and pieces of Japanese up since I've lived here.

I also love making music and despite being a hardware nut for most of the last 15 years, I transitioned into DAW only and settled on Logic over and I couldn't be happier. I do miss fiddling with the sliders and knobs of an analog synth though! 

Recently, I’ve been working on apps to enhance my guitar practice by integrating music theory into coding. I've also really enjoyed trying to develop apps that help me learn languages better. I used to be an English teacher and trying to combine that experience from a student perspective is a fun challenge. 

## 📚 Education
- **Master's in Data Analytics:** My thesis explored the effects of career trauma on UFC fighters, using machine learning models and extensive data visualization.
- **Postgraduate Diploma in Data Analytics:** I gained experience with R, Tableau, and SQL, developing statistical models and data visualization projects.
- **Undergraduate in International Business:** This foundation, combined with startup experience in China, fueled my interest in data science and problem-solving.

## 🎯 Goals & Aspirations: 
I'm actively looking for software engineering or Data related roles in Japan, but I'm open to anywhere in the world. I can still get working Holiday Visas for Australia, Canada and Switzerland and I can get a graduate Visa for America.
