# 👋 Hi, I'm Patrick Killeen

I'm a 33 year old Irish - Venezuelan. 

Since the pandemic, I've been reupskilling in tech, starting with a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Analytics, and just this September, I finished my Master's in Data Analytics.
I've spent the last year in Japan on a working holiday visa  where I worked as a Python Instructor and I'm looking forward to seeing what the next opportunity in life is going to be. 

## 🎓 Master's Thesis
My Master's thesis focused on the impact of cumulative head trauma on fighter performance in the UFC using Machine Learning. The project was broken down into three key steps:

1. **Scraping:** Collecting fight data and statistics from various sources using Python beautifulsoup and selenium. 
2. **Cleaning:** Organizing raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. This was done in R however some cleaning and joining was also performed in python using pandas and one or two issues were cleaned up in excel.
3. **Modeling:** Building predictive models to understand how career trauma affects fighter performance. The models were tested and created in both R and Python
4. **Visualizations** were added using seaborn, matplotlib and tableau to provide insights into the results of study.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, R,  SQL (PL/SQL, SQLite, Oracle).
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Flask, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Tableau
- **Platforms:** Big Query

-**Currently Learning:** Typescript, Javascript, Expo

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On
- **Weekly Organiser**:Organiser that is based on on medicine wall charts to prioritise repeating tasks
- **Game Development:** Experimenting with a roguelite FTL style autobattler using pygame and LLM generated events
- - **Anki Card Generator:** A React-based web app for creating Anki flashcards in both Japanese and English, aiming to facilitate language learning.

## 🛠️ Other Projects
- **Kanji Learning Help:** A React-based app that generates Anki cards to support N4/N5 level kanji learning, making language acquisition more structured and fun.
- **Guitar Fretboard Visualisier**: An app i built to experiment with flask that helps visualise the fretboard based on the note relationships rather than their position on the board.
- **Typing Speed Improver App**: App to improve the users typing speed based on their weakest performing key combinations. 


## 🎸 Personal Interests
Love learning languages, I speak fluent Spanish, pretty Mandarin (HSK3/4), I play videogames in French better than speak it and have picked up bits and pieces of Japanese up since i've lived here.

Recently, I’ve been working on apps to enhance my guitar practice by integrating music theory into coding. 
I also enjoy music production and exploring different ways to merge tech and creativity.

I'm passionate about creating tools that improve my skills and hobbies so a lot of my projects center around that. 

## 📚 Education
- **Master's in Data Analytics:** My thesis explored the effects of career trauma on UFC fighters, using machine learning models and extensive data visualization.
- **Postgraduate Diploma in Data Analytics:** I gained experience with R, Tableau, and SQL, developing statistical models and data visualization projects.
- **Undergraduate in International Business:** This foundation, combined with startup experience in China, fueled my interest in data science and problem-solving.

## 🎯 Goals & Aspirations: 
I'm actively looking for software engineering roles in Japan, but I'm open to anywhere in the world. I can still get working Holiday Visas for Australia, Canada and Switzerland and I can get a graduate Visa for America.
