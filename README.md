# 👋 Hi, I'm Patrick Killeen

I'm a 33 year old Irish - Venezuelan. 

Since the pandemic, I've been reupskilling in tech, starting with a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Analytics, and just this September, I finished my Master's in Data Analytics.
I've spent the last year in Japan on a working holiday visa and looking forward to seeing what the next opportunity in life is going to be. 

## 🎓 Master's Thesis
My Master's thesis focused on the impact of cumulative head trauma on fighter performance in the UFC using Machine Learning. The project was broken down into three key steps:

1. **Scraping:** Collecting fight data and statistics from various sources.
2. **Cleaning:** Organizing raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
3. **Modeling:** Building predictive models to understand how career trauma affects fighter performance.

Visualizations were added at the end to provide insights into the effects of factors like age, reach, and striking accuracy.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, C/C++, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL (PL/SQL, SQLite, Oracle)
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React Native, Expo, Express, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Tableau
- **Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On
- **Sentiment Analysis Tracker:** A web-based tool that gathers data from websites, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes the results on a dashboard. It’s built using React, Express, and VADER.
- **Programming Lessons for Kids:** Developing a curriculum that blends coding with English language learning, creating tools and interactive lessons to make programming accessible for younger audiences.
- **Game Development:** Experimenting with a Digimon World clone using modern web technologies, focusing on the gameplay mechanics and UI.

## 🛠️ Other Projects
- **Weekly Organizer:** A Python tool to help manage weekly tasks and goals, boosting productivity.
- **Kanji Learning Help:** A React-based app that generates Anki cards to support N4/N5 level kanji learning, making language acquisition more structured and fun.
- **Anki Card Generator:** A React-based web app for creating Anki flashcards in both Japanese and English, aiming to facilitate language learning.

## 🎸 Personal Interests
I'm passionate about creating tools that improve my skills and hobbies. 
Recently, I’ve been working on apps to enhance my guitar practice by integrating music theory into coding. 
I also enjoy music production and exploring different ways to merge tech and creativity.

## 📚 Education
- **Master's in Data Analytics:** My thesis explored the effects of career trauma on UFC fighters, using machine learning models and extensive data visualization.
- **Postgraduate Diploma in Data Analytics:** I gained experience with R, Tableau, and SQL, developing statistical models and data visualization projects.
- **Undergraduate in International Business:** This foundation, combined with startup experience in China, fueled my interest in data science and problem-solving.

## 🎯 Goals & Aspirations: 
I'm actively looking for software engineering roles in Japan, but I'm open to anywhere in the world. I can still get working Holiday Visas for Australia, Canada and Switzerland and I can get a graduate Visa for America.
